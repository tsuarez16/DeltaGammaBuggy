    <h2>CARNEGIE MELLON'S FINEST AND ONLY ALL WOMENS BUGGY TEAM.</h2>
    <h3> </h3>
    <p>From design, mechanics, to sprinting down Schenley, our team is about pushing limits.. and buggies. The Delta Gamma Buggy Team is proud to be Carnegie Mellon University’s only all-women’s
    buggy organization. What began as a way to join one of CMUss most beloved traditions has
    grown into a team defined by innovation, athleticism, and camaraderie. </p>

    <h2> WHAT IS BUGGY? </h2>
    <p>Buggy is a one-of-a-kind event that combines engineering and athletics. Each spring during
    Carnegie Mellons Spring Carnival, student organizations compete in time-trial races on a 4,400-foot course.
    The engineers get to design buggies using carbon fiber and custom braking systems. For the athletes, pushers run in relays, sprinting on flat sections and hills, then handing the buggy off at different points of the hill.</p>

    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <p>Each spring, student teams build and race "buggies" around a challenging course through Schenley Park as part of CMU's annual
    Spring Carnival. For Delta Gamma, its an opportunity to break barriers, push limits, and represent women in a tradition that has spanned generations.</p>
    <p>Whether you are cheering from the sidelines or being the buggy in itself, being part of DG Buggy means carrying a sense of pride and
    empowerment. We aim to inspire the next generation of women at Carnegie Mellon to dream big and push further.</p>
